This file is a draft of the new changes for http://www.jirka.org/ra/changes.html

<p>
<b>??? ??th 2018 edition, Version 5.0 (edition 5, 0th update):</b>
<p>
The motivation for this revision is to improve readability of existing material
rather than adding much new material.
To this end,
<b>39 new figures</b> were added (so 65 total) <!-- 26 in last edition -->
there are several new examples,
as well as reorganizing and expanding explanations throughout.
Furthermore,
<b>98 new exercises</b> were added bringing the total to 527 total
(plus two had to be replaced). <!-- 429 in last edition -->
<p>
A <b>List of Notations</b> is added at the back, giving a description and
a page number for the most relevant definition or use for the notations used
in the book.
<p>
There are the following more major additions:
<b>A short new subsection</b> in 0.3 on relations.
<b>Two new subsections</b> in 6.2 on limits of derivatives, and on power series.
I always felt like chapter 6 ends too abruptly if 6.3 is not covered.  This
adds a nice simpler application of swapping of limits with much easier proof
than Picard.
<b>A short new subsection</b> on limits of functions in 7.5, as this is
really used in chapter 8 of volume II.
<b>Section 4.3 was expanded</b> with a discussion on Taylor series, as
well as the second derivative test.
Throughout the book, some material that was in remarks, examples, and exercises
but was used often, was formalized into several new propositions.
<p>
Some exercises, examples, propositions were added, some theorems became
propositions, a few definitions, theorems, propositions, lemmas, corollaries,
and examples in 0.3, 1.4, 2.5, 3.4, 4.1, 4.2, 5.2, 7.1, 7.2, 7.3, 7.4 were
renumbered.  Figure numbers have changed.
<b>Existing exercise numbers are the same, except
exercises 2.5.1, 7.2.5 were replaced,
7.2.12 asks for the reverse implication (that was an erratum, as this was
already proved in the text),
in exercise 3.3.11 we require that the example is continuous,
exercise 4.4.6 was simplified very slightly (the original was a typo),
and due to new material, exercise 3.6.2 now asks for more, and exercise
6.2.7 is easier.  Exercise 7.5.9 is easier with a new proposition.
A couple of other exercises had errata fixed (0.3.5, 1.4.3,
5.4.2, 7.1.5).</b>
Other than this, the new edition is essentially backward compatible as usual.

<p>
A detailed list of changes:
<ol>
<li>Identify book as Volume I on the title page, and refer to Volume II
in the introduction.
<li>In the PDF the pages have been made slightly longer so that we can lower
the page count to save some paper.
<li>To be more consistent with what is a Theorem and what is a Proposition,
demote Theorems 2.1.10, 2.3.5, 2.3.7, 3.4.6, 5.2.2 to Propositions.
Also change Theorem 4.2.2 to a Lemma as that's more appropriate.
Numbering didn't change.
<li>Change the look of the figures to match the Volume II and
to better visually distinguish them from the surrounding text.
<li>Change the "basic analysis result" to $x \leq \epsilon$
for all $\epsilon &gt; 0$ implies $x \leq 0$.  This better fits the mantra that
in analysis we prove inequalities, and separates out the idea that to show
$x=0$ one proves $x \leq 0$ and $x \geq 0$.
<li>Add a short paragraph about naming of Theorem vs Proposition vs Lemma vs
Corollary, to answer a common question.
<li>Add a subsection on relations, equivalence relations,
and equivalence classes.  This renumbers the following
propositions, definitions, etc...
<li>Add figure for the sets $S$ and $T$ in 0.3
<li>Add figure for direct/inverse images in section 0.3.
<li>Add figure for showing ${\mathbb{N}}^2$ is countable.
<li>Add exercises 0.3.21, 0.3.22, 0.3.23, 0.3.24, 0.3.25.
<li>Add figure for least upper bound definition.
<li>Add note about uniqueness of sups and infs.
<li><b>In proposition 1.1.8, add the two very commonly used properties
as parts (vi) and (vii).</b>
<li>Add explicitly proposition 1.1.11 about an ordered field with
LUB property also having GLB property.
<li>Add link to Dedekind's Wikipedia page.
<li>In exercise 1.1.6, removed the "In particular, $A$ is infinite".  There
is no point in going into the distinction and it just confuses students.
<li>Add exercises 1.1.11, 1.1.12, 1.1.13, 1.1.14.
<li>Add footnote on impossibility of tuned pianos and rational roots
<li><b>In proposition 1.2.2 simplify matters by changing the statement to not
assume that $x \geq 0$.</b>  The original statement is given in the paragraph
below as a remark.
<li>Add figure to proof of the density of $\mathbb Q$ in section 1.2.
<li>Add exercise 1.2.14, 1.2.15, 1.2.16, 1.2.17.
<li>Change title of 1.3 to include "bounded functions".
<li>Add figure for a bounded function, its supremum and its infimum
in section 1.3.
<li>Add exercises 1.3.8, 1.3.9.
<li>Add Proposition 1.4.1 (which moves Theorem 1.4.1 to 1.4.2), which is the
characterization of intervals that we often use later, so better to formalize
it.  Proof is still an exercise.
<li>We never defined/open closed for unbounded intervals, although later on
we make a big deal about a closed and bounded interval.  To be more in line
with general usage, define what "unbounded closed" and
"unbounded open" intervals.
<li>In exercise 1.4.6, be more explicit about what the intersection of closed
intervals is, and explicitly mention boundedness.
That, is say the intersection is $\cap_{\lambda I} [a_\lambda,b_\lambda]$.
<li>Add exercise 1.4.10.
<li>In Proposition 1.5.1, add the inequalities for all representations as well,
since we use these facts later.  Also add the detail of the proof as it is
perhaps not as obvious to every reader.
<li>Mark exercise 1.5.6 as challenging and add a longer hint.  The real tricky
part is to get a bijection rather than two injections which is easier.
<li>Add exercise 1.5.8, which is really required in the proof, so that
we do not require things from chapter 2.  Be more explicit about its use
in the proof.
<li>Add figure on cantor diagonalization in section 1.5.
<li>Add more detail in proof of Proposition 1.5.3, to see how we use the
unique representation.
<li>Add exercises 1.5.7, 1.5.9
<li>Add a very short example of a tail of a sequence in 2.1.
<li>Add a diagram to proof of Proposition 2.1.15.
<li>Simplify the proof of squeeze lemma as suggested by Atilla YÄ±llmaz.
<li>Add example of showing $n^{1/n}$ going to 1 as a more subtle example of
the use of the ratio test.
<li>Simplify/symmetrize the proof of product of limits is the limit of the
product.  (Thanks to Harold Boas)
<li>Show the convergence/unboundedness of $\{ c^n \}$ in a somewhat 
a more elementary way without Bernoulli's inequality.
(Thanks to Harold Boas)
<li>Add exercises 2.2.13, 2.2.14, 2.2.15, 2.2.16.
<li>Add two figures in 2.3 for liminf and limsups, one for a random example,
and one for the given example.
<li>Expand the discussion of infinite limits and liminf/limsup for unbounded
sequences.  Add a proposition about unbounded monotone sequences, and a
proposition connecting the definition of liminf/limsup to the previous
definition for bounded sequences.
<li>Add exercises 2.3.15, 2.3.16, 2.3.17, 2.3.18, 2.3.19.
<li>Add figure to the example of geometric series with 1/2.
<li>Make the geometric series into a Proposition as we use it quite a bit.
Also use geometric series as an example for the divergence if terms do not
go to 0, that is when $r \notin (-1,1)$.
<li>Mention the ``infinite triangle inequality'' in text in 2.5,
I always do in class.
These two things renumber the subsequent examples, propositions, etc... in 2.5
<li><b>Replace exercise 2.5.1</b>.  The exercise was proved in example 0.3.8
and already used previously.
<li>Add exercises 2.5.14, 2.5.15, 2.5.16, 2.5.17.
<li>Add a sentence and notation to the figure about possible
non-convergence at the endpoints of the radius of convergence.
<li>Add exercises 2.6.13, 2.6.14.
<li>Add a note and a footnote on the other common notations for the various
limits of restrictions.
<li>Add Corollary after 3.1.12 for the absolute value, which shifts the
numbering of propositions and examples by one in 3.1.
<li>Add exercises 3.1.15, 3.1.16.
<li>Expand example 3.2.10 a little bit, and add a figure for the example.
<li>Add exercises 3.2.17, 3.2.18, 3.2.19.
<li>Add figure for definition of absolute minimum and maximum.
<li>Add corollary 3.3.12 whose proof is the existing exercise 3.3.7.
<li><b>In exercise 3.3.11 add the missing continuity hypothesis</b>.
Otherwise the exercise is too easy (it is already easy).
<li>Add exercise 3.3.14, 3.3.15, 3.3.16, 3.3.17.
<li>Swap examples 3.4.2 and 3.4.3, they make a lot more sense in that order.
<li>In Section 3.4 add a very short application of the continuous extension.
<li>Add figure for the idea of the proof of the product rule, that is,
a picture of the identity given as hint.
<li>Add exercises 3.4.15, 3.4.16, 3.4.17.
<li>Add exercise 3.5.9.
<li>Strengthen Proposition 3.6.2 to include limits at infinity,
which means that <b>Exercise 3.6.2 asks for a bit more</b>
since two new statements must be proved.
<li>Add exercises 3.6.12, 3.6.13, 3.6.14, 3.6.15.
<li>Actually prove the use of intermediate value theorem in proof of
corollary 3.6.3.
<li>Add figure to Example 3.6.5.
<li>Add figure to Example 3.6.7.
<li>Add examples 4.1.3, 4.1.4 which moves everything down a number in 4.1.
<li>Add link to Schwarz and Bunyakovsky and give a short note on the name
in a footnote.
<li>Add exercises 4.1.13, 4.1.14, 4.1.15.
<li>Reorganize the proof of Mean value theorem a little bit, add some
motivation for the proof, and move the figure up
earlier as it gives an idea for the proof.
<li>Make Example 4.2.8 into a Proposition since that's what it really is.
Then we can refer to it rather than the exercise that proves it later.
<li>The proof of exercise 4.2.9 was a little too challenging.  In essence
one reproves Cauchy's mean value theorem anyway, so add that as a theorem,
and add an exercise to prove it.  This causes some renumbering in 4.2.
<li>Add a proposition about extension of derivatives to the boundary as that
is a in fact quite useful and has a very quick and straightforward
proof which is left as exercise.
<li>Add small note about measuring speed with aircraft and mean value theorem.
<li>Add some motivation to the proof of Darboux's theorem, and
add a figure.
<li>Add exercises 4.2.13, 4.2.14, 4.2.15.
<li>Add two figures for Taylor's theorem section (4.3).
<li>Mention Taylor series and connection to power series in 4.3.
<li>Add quick application of Taylor's theorem to prove second derivative test.
Proposition 4.3.3.
<li>Add exercises 4.3.9, 4.3.10, 4.3.11.
<li>Rewrite proof of Lemma 4.4.1, and use clearer variable names.
<li>Add figure to Example 4.4.5.
<li><b>Modify Exercise 4.4.6 very slightly</b>, replace ``interval'' with
``open interval''.  The distinction is irrelevant for how one proves it
and considering other types of intervals makes the proof longer.
<li>Add figure to the proof of Proposition 5.1.7.
<li>Add figure to Proposition 5.1.10.
<li>Add figure to Example 5.1.12.
<li>Add proposition on the sub/super additivity as proposition 5.2.5,
so all other propositions, theorems, and lemmas shift by one in 5.2.
<li>In the monotonicity proposition, state it for upper and lower integrals
as well, we prove that anyway, it fits better with the style of exposition
in this book, and it can be useful in proofs.
<li>Add proposition for the integrability of monotone functions.
We use this later, it is better to just refer to a proposition
than an exercise, and it is also genuinely useful.
<li>Add exercise 5.2.17.
<li>Add figure to proof of the fundamental theorem of calculus in 5.3.
<li>Add remarks about other definitions of logarithm and the exponential,
and about the uniqueness and existence following from a subset
of the given conditions.
<li>Add exercise 5.4.11.
<li>Improve the exposition of the summability of the sinc function in
example 5.5.12 and add another figure to the example to show the bound.
<li>Add figure for integral test for series in 5.5.
<li>Add figure to example 6.1.4.
<li>Add figure to definition uniform convergence in 6.1.
<li>Add exercise 6.1.12, 6.1.13, 6.1.14.
<li>Add subsection to 6.2 on swapping of limit of functions and derivatives
for continuously differentiable functions.
<b>This makes exercise 6.2.7 much easier</b> as we essentially do the main
bit as a theorem.  There is a new figure in this subsection.
<li>Add subsection to 6.2 on convergence, differentiation, and integration
of power series.
<li>Change hint in 6.2.1 to be simpler, $|x|^{1+1/n}$ works but it is a
bit messy to prove all the details.
<li>Add exercises 6.2.15, 6.2.16, 6.2.17, 6.2.18, 6.2.19, 6.2.20, 6.2.21.
<li>Add remark about weaker solutions to ODEs using the integral equation.
<li>Use the more common interior notation in 6.3, and in 7.6.
<li>Add exercises 6.3.7, 6.3.8, 6.3.9.
<li>Improve triangle inequality figure in 7.1.
<li>Add example of complex numbers to 7.1, and an example of a sphere,
that renumbers the rest of the examples and propositions in 7.1.
<li>Add exercises 7.1.9, 7.1.10, 7.1.11, 7.1.12, 7.1.13.
<li>Improve the open set figure in 7.2.
<li>Add Propositions 7.2.11 and 7.2.12 that codify some of the
subspace topology things we keep using.  This renumbers the rest of the
definitions, examples, and propositions in 7.2.
<li>Simplify proof of Proposition 7.2.15, as the conclusion was already
proved in exercise in 1.4, and is formalized in Proposition 1.4.1.
<li><b>Replace exercise 7.2.5</b>, the conclusion was already proved
in exercise 1.4.3 (in more generality, in fact).
<li><b>In Exercise 7.2.12</b> the implication goes the other way (erratum in
earlier versions), as is needed in the text.
<li>Add figures to Propositions 7.2.9, 7.2.13, 7.2.15, and 7.2.26.
<li>Add $(0,\infty)$ and $[0,\infty)$ as an examples of an open and
closed sets in ${\mathbb{R}}$ to Example 7.2.5.
<li>Add footnote about empty sets and connectedness.
<li>Add exercises 7.2.15, 7.2.16, 7.2.17, 7.2.18.
<li>Add figure to definition of convergence in 7.3.
<li>Add example to 7.3 of $C([0,1],{\mathbb{R}})$ where convergence is the
uniform convergence.  This renumbers the following examples, propositions,
etc...
<li>Add remark that pointwise convergence does not come from a metric.
<li>Add example for convergence in the complex numbers.
<li>Add exercises 7.3.13, 7.3.14.
<li>Add an example (in fact a set of 4 examples) of compact and noncompact
sets on the real numbers in 7.4.  This again renumbers the remaining
propositions, etc...
<li>Add proposition that $C([a,b],\R)$ is a complete metric space.
<li>Add proposition that a closed subset of a complete metric space is
complete, that is used later.
<li>Add remark at the end of 7.4 about Cauchy depending on the actual metric
and not just on the topology, along with an exercise working through the
counterexample.
<li>Add an example for the Lebesgue covering lemma, finding a $\delta$ for a
cover.
<li>Add figures to proof of Proposition 7.4.9, Lebesgue covering lemma, and 
Theorem 7.4.11.
<li>Add exercises 7.4.17, 7.4.18, 7.4.19, 7.4.20.
<li>Add figure for Lemma 7.5.7.
<li>Add a proposition 7.5.12 on continuity of functions defined by integration.
Makes exercise 7.5.9 simpler, but it seemed to that most students missed the
subtlety, and we use this result later a few times.
<li>Add exercises 7.5.11, 7.5.12, 7.5.13, 7.5.14, 7.5.15, 7.5.16, 7.5.17,
  7.5.18.
<li>Make notation more in line with the rest of the chapter in 7.6.
<li>Move all exercises to the Exercises subsection 7.6 to be consistent
with the rest of the book.
<li>Add exercise 7.6.11.
</ol>
