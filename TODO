Not so necessary but nice to haves

* Add appendix to Vol I on logic and formal proof writing similar to the Pitt
  one

MAYBEs:

* Maybe mark examples that are used in the sequel somehow. (This may be a
  daunting task, and more imprecise than one imagines, as what does "use"
  mean: What if it is used in a later example that isn't used otherwise?
  What if it is used in an optional section?  What if it appears in an
  offhand remark?)
* Maybe mark exercises whose proof is used in the text later.  Same issues
  as above.
* Maybe add appendix to Vol I on construction of the reals.  Perhaps start with
  construction of $\Q$ and then finish with Dedekind cuts.
