Must be done for v2.0:

* Vol I and Vol II: continuous limits in R^n, we're using this in 8.3,
  but I don't think it's been defined.  Either define it in 8.2, or
  perhaps in Chap. 7 somewhere.  It should be a quick half page
  definition.
* Vol II: The fubini part B exercise is maybe too stupid, it's essentially
  just noticing that the order of the variables doesn't matter.  
  Should be replaced I think.

I think should be done for v2.0:

* Vol II: the seq of functions chapter.  Can be slightly
   simplified as some of the things in there have already been proved.


Not so necessary but nice to haves

* Add appendix to Vol I on logic and formal proof writing similar to the Pitt
  one

MAYBEs:

* Maybe mark examples that are used in the sequel somehow. (This may be a
  daunting task, and more imprecise than one imagines, as what does "use"
  mean: What if it is used in a later example that isn't used otherwise?
  What if it is used in an optional section?  What if it appears in an
  offhand remark?)
* Maybe mark exercises whose proof is used in the text later.  Same issues
  as above.
* Maybe add appendix to Vol I on construction of the reals.  Perhaps start with
  construction of $\Q$ and then finish with Dedekind cuts.
