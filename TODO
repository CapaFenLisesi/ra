MAYBEs:
* Maybe mark examples that are used in the sequel somehow. (This may be a
  daunting task, and more imprecise than one imagines, as what does "use"
  mean: What if it is used in a later example that isn't used otherwise?
  What if it is used in an optional section?  What if it appears in an
  offhand remark?)
* Maybe mark exercises whose proof is used in the text later.  Same issues
  as above.
