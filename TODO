Long term:

* Add the "crash course on Lebesgue" chapter to Vol II
* Add a chapter on submanifolds and differential forms.

For next edition:

* Vol II:  Expand on 11.5, make it more about maximum principle.  Proof of the
  lemma 11.5 for analytic functions can still be left as an exercise.  Proof
  of the maximum principle is also an exercise, but state both, and maybe
  state one or two consequences of the principle other than fundamental
  theorem of calculus.

Not so necessary but nice to haves

* Add appendix to Vol I on logic and formal proof writing similar to the Pitt
  one

MAYBEs:

* Maybe mark examples that are used in the sequel somehow. (This may be a
  daunting task, and more imprecise than one imagines, as what does "use"
  mean: What if it is used in a later example that isn't used otherwise?
  What if it is used in an optional section?  What if it appears in an
  offhand remark?)
* Maybe mark exercises whose proof is used in the text later.  Same issues
  as above.
* Maybe add appendix to Vol I on construction of the reals.  Perhaps start
  with construction of $\Q$ and then finish with Dedekind cuts.
