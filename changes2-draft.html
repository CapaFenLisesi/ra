<b>??? ??th 2018 edition, Version 2.0 (edition 2, 0th update):</b>
<p>

Numbering of definitions, examples, propositions changed in 8.1, 10.1

<b>Numbering of exercises is unchanged.</b>

<ol>
<li><b>New section 10.7</b> on change of variables.
<li><b>New chapter 11</b> on Arzela-Ascoli, Stone-Weierstrass, power series,
and Fourier series.
<li>Add figure showing vector as an arrow and discussion about this
 for those that do not remember it from vector calculus.
<li>Add a paragraph about simple algebraic facts such that $0v=v$.
<li>Add footnote about linear independence for arbitrary sets in 8.1.
<li>Add example that span of $t^n$ is ${\mathbb{R}}[t]$.
<li>Add remark about proving a set is a subspace.
<li>We also use the words "linear operator" for $L(X,Y)$,
and it is for $L(X)$ that we say "linear operator on $X$",
so update the definition appropriately.
<li>Add exercise 8.1.19
<li>Proposition 8.2.4 doesn't need $Y$ to be finite dimensional,
  same in the exercise 8.2.12, so no need to assume it.
<li>In Proposition 8.2.5, emphasize where the finiteness of dimension is
  needed.
<li>Use $GL(X)$ as notation for invertible linear operators.
<li>Give more detail on why mapping between matrices and linear operators is
one to one once a basis is fixed.
<li>Add a commutative diagram to the independence on basis discussion.
<li>Reorder the definition of sign of a permutation to be more logical.
<li>Add short example of permutation as transpositions.
<li>Add exercises 8.2.14, 8.2.15, 8.2.16, 8.2.17, 8.2.18, 8.2.19
<li>Add figure to definitions 8.3.1 and 8.3.7.
<li>Add figure for differentiable curve and its derivative.
<li>Add figure to exercises 8.3.5 and 8.3.6.
<li>Add exercise 8.3.14
<li>Add graph to figure in example 8.4.3 (and adjust the formulas)
<li>Add exercises 8.4.7, 8.4.8, 8.4.9
<li>Add a couple of figures to proof of the inverse function theorem.
<li>Add a short paragraph about the famous Jacobian conjecture.
<li>make the remark at the end of 8.5 into an actual "remark"
<li>Add observation about solving a bunch of equations not just for $s=0$ for
  the implicit function theorem.
<li>Add exercises 8.5.9, 8.5.10, 8.5.11
<li>Add exercises 8.6.5, 8.6.6
<li>Add figure to examples 9.2.2, 9.2.3, 9.2.11, 9.2.13, 9.2.18
<li>Add figure to definition 9.3.5
<li>Add Example 10.1.16 of compact support with a figure, following
  examples/propositions in 10.1 are renumbered.
<li>Add corollary for the Riemann integrability theorem showing that it is
  an algebra, that min and max of two functions are Riemann integrable and
  so is the absolute value.
<li>Add exercises 10.4.6, 10.4.7, 10.4.8, 10.4.9, 10.4.10, 10.4.11
<li>Add exercises 10.5.5, 10.5.6, 10.5.7
<li>In 10.6, add figure for positive orientation and a figure illustrating
  the three types of domains.
<li>Many minor improvements in style and clarity, plus several
small new example throughout.
<li>Fix <a href="errata2.html">errata</a>.
</ol>
