Numbering of definitions, examples, propositions changed in 8.1, 10.1

<b>Numbering of exercises is unchanged.</b>

<ol>
<li>Add a paragraph about simple algebraic facts such that $0v=v$.
<li>Add footnote about linear independence for arbitrary sets in 8.1.
<li>Add example that span of $t^n$ is ${\mathbb{R}}[t]$.
<li>Add remark about proving a set is a subspace.
<li>Add exercise 8.1.19
<li>Proposition 8.2.4 doesn't need $Y$ to be finite dimensional,
  same in the exercise 8.2.12, so no need to assume it.
<li>In Proposition 8.2.5, emphasize where the finiteness of dimension is
  needed.
<li>Reorder the definition of sign of a permutation to be more logical.
<li>Add figure to definitions 8.3.1 and 8.3.7.
<li>Add figure to exercises 8.3.5 and 8.3.6.
<li>Add graph to figure in example 8.4.3 (and adjust the formulas)
<li>Add figure to examples 9.2.2, 9.2.3, 9.2.11, 9.2.13, 9.2.18
<li>Add figure to definition 9.3.5
<li>Add Example 10.1.16 of compact support with a figure, following
  examples/propositions in 10.1 are renumbered.
<li>In 10.6, add figure for positive orientation and a figure illustrating the three types of domains.
<li>Many minor improvements in style and clarity, plus several
small new example throughout.
<li>Fix <a href="errata2.html">errata</a>.
