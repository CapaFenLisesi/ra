Basic Analysis: Introduction to Real Analysis
---------------------------------------------

Volume I and II both in this directory

* realanal.tex is Volume I
* realanal2.tex is Volume II

A free online textbook.  See http://www.jirka.org/ra/

* realanal3.tex is an unfinished set of topics possibly to just add to Volume II
* similarly extras.tex and stieltjes.tex

Note: Some of the shell scripts here are really for me
and are really hacky ways to just do things.  Feel free to ignore
them
