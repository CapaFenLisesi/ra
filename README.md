Basic Analysis: Introduction to Real Analysis
---------------------------------------------

Volume I and II both in this directory

* realanal.tex is Volume I
* realanal2.tex is Volume II

A free online textbook.  See http://www.jirka.org/ra/

* wip/realanal3.tex is an unfinished set of topics possibly to just add to Volume II
* similarly wip/extras.tex and wip/stieltjes.tex


* publish.sh compiles the volume I file to pdf
* publish2.sh compiles the volume II file to pdf
* make-tar.sh makes a tarball

Note that the tex sources require a very recent LaTeX, if your latex does not
have a recent enough ocgx2 package, you can simply comment out that line in
the preamble.
